# Getting Started

## Documentation Structure

The User Guide is structured as a step-by-step tutorial, designed to progressively introduce KuboCD features.

The guide is complemented by a Reference section for detailed technical information.

To get started, we recommend installing KuboCD using the method appropriate for your environment:

- **Existing Cluster**: [Installing KuboCD on an Existing Cluster](user-guide/120-existing-cluster.md)
- **Local Workstation**: [Installing KuboCD on a Local Kind Cluster](user-guide/110-kind.md)

Once installed, proceed to [A First Deployment](user-guide/130-a-first-deployment.md).
