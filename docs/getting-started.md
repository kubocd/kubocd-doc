# Getting started

## How This Manual Is Structured

The User Guide is organized as a step-by-step tutorial, designed to gradually introduce the various features of KuboCD.

It is complemented by a 'Reference' section.

As a starting point, we recommend installing KuboCD:

- If you have a test cluster available: [Installing KuboCD on an Existing Cluster](user-guide/120-existing-cluster.md).
- If you prefer to test locally on your workstation: [Installing KuboCD on a Local Kind Cluster](user-guide/110-kind.md)

Then continue with [A First Deployment](user-guide/130-a-first-deployment.md).
