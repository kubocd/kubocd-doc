🔍 Feature Comparison: KuboCD vs Helm vs FluxCD

| Feature / Tool	| KuboCD           | Helm | FluxCD                       |
| --- |------------------| --- |------------------------------|
| Primary Role | Application packaging & deployment abstraction | Templating and deploying Kubernetes manifests | GitOps continuous delivery   |
| User Audience | Platform Engineers, AppOps, Developers | DevOps, Kubernetes Experts | DevOps, SREs | 
| Ease of Use | High (abstracts deployment logic) | Medium (requires Helm knowledge) | Medium (requires GitOps understanding) |
| Supports GitOps | ✅ (via integration with FluxCD) | ⚠️ (manual integration needed) | ✅ (native GitOps controller) |
| Uses Helm charts | ✅ (packages & manages them) | ✅ (core functionality) | ✅ (can deploy HelmReleases) |
| Custom Resources | Release, Context | None (CLI and chart format) | HelmRelease, Kustomization, etc. |
| Deployment Abstraction | ✅ (encapsulates values, logic) | ❌ (user-defined values needed at deploy) | ❌ (relies on raw manifests or Helm) |
| OCI Image Support | ✅ (Packages are OCI images) | ✅ (since Helm v3.8+) | ✅ (via Helm OCI support) |
| Ideal Use Case | Standardizing deployments across teams | Managing complex app deployments manually | Automating deployments from Git |


✅ When to Use KuboCD
KuboCD is particularly useful when:

🔁 You want to standardize application deployment workflows across teams and environments, without requiring everyone to master Helm or Kubernetes internals.

🧩 You are already using GitOps tools like FluxCD or ArgoCD, and need a structured way to package and manage applications as versioned, portable artifacts.

📦 You want to encapsulate application configuration and logic into reusable, declarative units (Packages), decoupled from cluster-specific deployment scripts.

🛠️ You need to simplify access to existing Helm charts for developers, while enforcing consistency and best practices through curated Releases.

🚀 You want to bootstrap entire environments (including base system components like ingress controllers, operators, etc.) in a fully automated way.
