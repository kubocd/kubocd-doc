This is a technical documentation about a Kubernetes product named KuboCD aimed to ease application deployment
Built with mkdocs with some extension.
It has been written in poor globish by a French native.
Product source code is at https://github.com/kubocd/kubocd
Could you rewrite docs/getting-started in correct technical english.
Don't touch the remaining of the manuel for now.

now, rewrite docs/110-kind.md

now, rewrite all other files in docs folder


refactor the reference part, using some form of table for a prettiest layout. Refactor the 'Release' page only for now

now, refactor all other reference pages.
